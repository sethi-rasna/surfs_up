# Surf's Up Analysis
## Overview

### Purpose:

We did an analaysis of the weather on Oahu from the month of June and the month of December to see what the viability of opening up tbe Surf'n'Shake shop would be. Investor, W. Avy, asked us to do this analysis to see what the weather is like during the high and the low season. Based on this analysis, it might be possible to not only open the shop on Oahu but other islands in Hawaii as well, depending on their weather patterns.

### Methodology

We used an sqlite database to retrieve the temperature data in Oahu via queries and then ran the summary statistics on this data using Python.  

### Air Temperature Results

###June

 - The tempertures remain ideal at this time and stead around the mid 70s and low 80s
 - The average temperture is about 75 degrees 
 - Temperatures reached a max of 85 degrees and the temperatures reached a minimum of 64 degrees.

###December

  - Temperatures remains steady in the mid-70s which is still great for a shop liek Surf'n'Shake
  - The average temperature remains about 71 degrees 
  - The nights are cooler though, reaching around the high 50s and low 60s
  
## Summary Findings:

  - During the day, both June and December are ideal weather conditions for a surf and an ice cream shop. June's weather is a little better, but December is good as well.
  - At night, December might be a little chillier for ice cream so perhaps serving hot chocolate in addition to ice cream might be an option.
  
## Recommendations:
  - Look at other areas of Hawaii for expansion to see if there are other locations that may be good for an ice cream/surf shop.
  - For the surfing purposes, get water temperatures for the on and off seasons to see what the ideal time of year for to provide surfing services would be.
